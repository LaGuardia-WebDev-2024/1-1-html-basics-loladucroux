  "Poems" </h1>
<h2>
  By me!
  </h2>
  <P>
    I started writing poems when I was in school
    I'd look out the window all day and just drool
    <P>
      
  </P>
    The poems I wrote were nothing but fun
    until one lonely day when my feelings came undone
    <P>
      
  </P>
    I don't show people my poems I don't care what they think
    though why would I, it's into my own thoughts that I sink
    <P>
    I used to write these poems for you until it broke me to pieces
    now all I write has a whole with my anagapesis
    <P>
     So I write about the rain and how I feel about school
      about my cheek out the window, as I sit there and drool
  </P>
